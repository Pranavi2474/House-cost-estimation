# House cost estimation 

House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to 
accurately estimate house prices based on various features such as 
location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other relevant 
property details. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model 
learns patterns and relationships from historical housing data to 
predict the cost of houses more efficiently than traditional methods.

Project Overview
Housing price estimation is a
 critical problem in real estate, helping buyers, sellers, and agents 
make informed decisions. This project explores different machine 
learning regression algorithms to build a predictive model that 
estimates house prices with high accuracy.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw data to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Feature Engineering: Selected and created relevant features that impact house prices.

Model Training:
 Applied multiple regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, 
Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to find the best 
fit.

Model Evaluation: Used metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Improved model accuracy through techniques like Grid Search and Cross-Validation.
Prediction Interface: Provided a simple interface (could be a script or a web app) for users to input house features and get estimated prices.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization
Results

The best-performing model 
achieved a prediction accuracy
demonstrating the potential of machine learning in real estate price 
estimation.
